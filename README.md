# Aerospace-Bearing-Life-Analysis
A data driven approach towards life predicition of aerospace ball bearings based on the endurance limit dataset.

# Overview
This repository contains the reference research papers and my final presentation submitted in the Design Credit course.

The presentation consists of theory ,observations ,results ,conclusions and future work if any interested student would like to continue this project.

# Software 
MATLABhttps://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html has been used for evaluating the parameters and plotting the graphs because of its extensive plotting module and relevant inbuilt functions.
